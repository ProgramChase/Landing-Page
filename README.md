# Landing-Page

Notes: 08/28/23 - Started project. Given a reference image and another image of fonts and colors used. The goal for this project is to roll out an entire webpage using flexbox. Hopefully after this Project, I will have a clearer understanding of the format; the functionality of flex-containers and flex-items. 

The website will contain 4 main sections + a footer.

Work on HTML first and then do CSS. Utilize the flexbox exercises. Search things on google if I need clarification.
