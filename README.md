# Landing-Page

Notes: 08/28/23 - Started project. Given a reference image and another image of fonts and colors used. The goal for this project is to roll out an entire webpage using flexbox. Hopefully after this Project, I will have a clearer understanding of the format; the functionality of flex-containers and flex-items. 

The website will contain 4 main sections + a footer.

Work on HTML first and then do CSS. Utilize the flexbox exercises. Search things on google if I need clarification.

08/29/23 - Added some html. Will revise it; not set in stone. So, four main sections... Header, body (detail 1 + detail 2), footer... I think I am going to do the header first... HTML + CSS. 

08/30/23 - Uncommented some of the code on the HTML file. Added styling in the CSS file. Will have to revise when necessary. I've been trying to reduce my redundancy with my code. I'm pretty sure somewhere in the cascade sheet, I probably have repetition.
